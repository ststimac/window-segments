What information might this feature expose to Web sites or other parties, and for what purposes is that exposure necessary?
This feature exposes information about a foldable device, when a window is spanning across a fold. For some devices, this information may already be available via window.screen properties. This exposure is necessary for web developers to be able to adaptively position content away from the fold/hinge.

Is this specification exposing the minimum amount of information necessary to power the feature?
Yes, it is only exposing the geometry of the fold.

How does this specification deal with personal information or personally-identifiable information or information derived thereof?
No personal information is exposed via this feature.

How does this specification deal with sensitive information?
N/A

Does this specification introduce new state for an origin that persists across browsing sessions?
No.

What information from the underlying platform, e.g. configuration data, is exposed by this specification to an origin?
The geometry of a device that has a fold or hinge.

Does this specification allow an origin access to sensors on a user’s device?
No.

What data does this specification expose to an origin? Please also document what data is identical to data exposed by other features, in the same or different contexts.
The presence of a fold is indeed a bit of entropy in identifying individuals. However, as noted above, this information can in many cases be derived from existing information from the window.screen properties.

Does this specification enable new script execution/loading mechanisms?
No.

Does this specification allow an origin to access other devices?
No.

Does this specification allow an origin some measure of control over a user agent’s native UI?
No.

What temporary identifiers might this specification create or expose to the web?
No identifiers are created or exposed.

How does this specification distinguish between behavior in first-party and third-party contexts?
This feature does not distinguish between these contexts.

How does this specification work in the context of a user agent’s Private Browsing or "incognito" mode?
This feature does not distinguish between these modes.

Does this specification have a "Security Considerations" and "Privacy Considerations" section?
Yes.

Does this specification allow downgrading default security characteristics?
No.
